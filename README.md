# My React Beer App
I mainly built this app for fun using the BreweryDB API to pull info for the name of a beer you pass in as input. The tech stack it uses is Node, Express, React, React Hooks, CSS, JSX, ES6, and a smidge of tailwind.css cause I wanted to check it out.

## [Check it out here](https://stark-badlands-62892.herokuapp.com)
## It is hosted on Heroku so it takes between 5 and 8 seconds to spin up the web dyno.
