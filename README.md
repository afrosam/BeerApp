# My React Beer App
I mainly built this app for fun using the BreweryDB API to pull info for the name of a beer you pass in as input. The tech stack it uses is Node, Express, React, React Hooks, CSS, JSX, ES6, and a smidge of tailwind.css cause I wanted to check it out.

If you are trying to test it locally you will need:
  1. To get a BreweryDB API key
  2. Add a "BREW_KEY" environment variable housing your breweryDB API key to the .env file
  
### Be aware I am using the sandbox version of the API so results may vary.

## [Check it out here](https://stark-badlands-62892.herokuapp.com)
### It is hosted on Heroku so it takes between 5 and 8 seconds to spin up the web dyno.
